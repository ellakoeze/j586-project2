							<div id="first-slide"><p>In June 2015, the US Supreme Court is expected to issue a decision on same-sex marriage that will create a nationwide standard for marriage equality. For now, however, laws and restrictions on same-sex marriage are a state-by-state hodge-podge of judicial rulings, consitutional amendments, and partisan legislation.</p><p>As in many states, the road to marriage equality in North Carolina has been a bumpy one, with legislative roadblocks and confusing jurisdictional debates along the way. Keeping track of how it all fits together can be confusing.</p><p>Luckily, this timeline will take you through the story from start to finish; covering all you need to know about North Carolina's road to marriage equality!</p>
